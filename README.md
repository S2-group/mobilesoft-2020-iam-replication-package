### Overview of the replication package
---

This replication package is structured as follows:

```
malavolta
    .
    |--- data_analysis/       		The data that has been extracted during the iterative content analysis and the thematic analysis phases, and the R script for plotting the extracted data (see below).
    |
    |--- dataset/             		The full dataset of ROS-based systems mined from GitHub, including also the Python scripts for rebuilding/updating the dataset and the raw data produced in all intermediate steps.
    |
    |--- questionnaire/   	List of contacted participants, raw data of the responses.
    |
    |--- MobileSoft_2020.pdf             A copy of the paper in pdf format
```

Each of the folders listed above are described in details in the remaining of this readme.

### Data analysis
---
```
data_analysis
    .
    |--- RQ1_codes_and_selection_criteria.pdf   The code we used for classifying each repository for answering RQ1 and the inclusion/exclusion criteria for selecting relevant repositories for our dataset    
    |--- analysis.r                             The R script we used for generating the plots reported in the article
    |--- documentation_fragments.csv            Raw textual fragments extracted from the documentation of ROS-based systems, with full traceability information about which guideline it generates and the specific repository it is coming from
    |--- guidelines_definitions.csv             Raw data containing the guidelines defined during the analysis for answering RQ2 with additional data about how we solved conflicts, their computed usefulness, etc.
```
The data in the CSV files has been manually, collaboratively, and iteratively extracted by the authors of the paper. The steps for recreating the plots presented in the paper the list of contributors to contact for replicating this study are presented [here](./INSTALL.md). 

### Dataset
---
```
dataset
    	.
	|--- manual_selection_gitlab.pdf                    16 out of 46 GitLab projects were not hosted on gitlab.com, so we performed all the filtering steps manually in those cases. This is the data we manually extracted about the 16 Gitlab repositories resulting from this manual step
	|--- repos_dataset_all.csv                          Automatically filtered repositories (598)
	|--- repos_dataset_selected.csv                     Manually filtered repositories (335)
	|--- repos_dataset_selected_sadoc.csv               Repositories containing a description of the software architecture of the robotic system (115)
	|--- repos_filtering_intermediate_numbers.pdf       Raw numbers about each single filtering step applied for building the dataset of ROS-based repositories
	|--- repos_filtering_statistics.pdf                 Tables showing descriptive statistics about the various repositories selected before and after the manual selection, and after the check about the architecture documentation
	|--- repos_golden_set.pdf                           Contains the list of repositories we knew a priori were good candidates for our study and we used such a set for (i) double check if our repository filtering steps were too strict and (ii) for piloting the manual analysis of the contents of the repositories
	|--- repos_mining_data/                             
	│   |--- Archive.zip                                Archive containing all the raw data related to our filtering steps, including intermediate data coming from GHTorrent, raw data produced by rosmap, and the raw data obtained at each single filtering step
	|--- repos_mining_scripts/                              
	    |--- cloner.py                                  Clones GitHub repositories based on a list provided as CSV file
	    |--- detector.py                                Given locally-cloned repositories, it detects which ones contain at least one ROS launch file (either in Python or XML)
	    |--- explorer.py                                Given the results of rosmap and GHTorrent, it performs all  filtering steps shown in Figure 4 in the paper (until step 9, step 10 is manual)
	    |--- ghtorrent_queries.sql                      Contains all SQL queries targeting GHTorrent  
	    |--- merge_counter.py                           Counts and merges duplicate results between rosmap and GHTorrent
	    |--- metrics_manager.py                         Computes a set of metrics on all targeted repositories (e.g., number of PRs, number of commits, etc.)
	    |--- visit_website.scpt                         Auxiliary script for programmatically visiting a given URL using Google Chrome in MacOS
